# game-of-life

- first steps for running - 

In this version, the first time running the server, and opening up the local site in your browser, you will be greeted with a big blank square box, and  buttons at the bottom of this box.

The app starts in "Draw Pixel" mode by default. We suggest you click on the screen anywhere and a "pixel" - a black square - will be drawn. Click around creating pixels. For a great effect create 2 lines of pixels 1-2 pixels apart.

Then click on the "Run" button on the bottom of the box right-hand side. The screen will come to life with pixels appearing and dissapearing until some stable pattern occurs. You can use the slider to speed up or slow down the running of Game of Life!
